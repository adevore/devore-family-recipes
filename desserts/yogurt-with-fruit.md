Yogurt with fruit

# Ingredients

* 1 cup vanilla Greek yogurt
* Fruit, cubed
* Balsamic vinegar

# Tips

## Yogurt

To reduce sugar content, find a yogurt with low amounts of added sugar.
Kroger stores carry a brand with around 3 grams of added sugar. The
Balsamic vinegar and fruit add plenty of sweetness.

## Fruit

Sweet, soft fruits are best. My favorites so far are peaches, nectarines,
and figs.

## Balsamic Vinegar

Any balsamic vinegar will add flavor, but an infused vinegar can add to
the dessert feeling. Fig-infused balsamic vinegar worked well with
figs.
