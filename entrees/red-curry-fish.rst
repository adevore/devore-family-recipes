Red Curry Fish
==============

:date: 29-11-2015

Ingredients
-----------

* 1/2 to 1 lb. fish fillet (halibut, tilapia, cod), cut in 3-4 inch chunks
* 2 to 2 1/2 cups chopped eggplant
* 1 to 2 heads baby bok choy
* 1/2 can coconut milk, shaken in can
* 1 1/2 cups chicken stock
* 1 bay leaf
* 2 tbsp fish sauce
* 1/2 tsp brown sugar
* 1 to 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 3 to 4 tbsp red curry paste
  
Addons
------

* 1 onion, chopped (optional)
* 1 to 2 green peppers, chopped (optional)
* 1/4 cup fresh coriander or cilantro (optional)

Preparation
-----------

1. Separate the bok choy leaves from the stems.
2. If including onions and/or green peppers, stir fry them with the bok choy stems.
3. Wash the fish.
4. Warm the wok or frying pan over medium-high heat. Combine the curry paste,
   3-4 tbsp coconut milk, and chicken stock. Bring to a boil.
5. Add eggplant. Reduce heat to medium-low or until you get a nice simmer. Cover
   with lid and simmer 6-7 minutes.
6. Add the fish and bok choy, "pushing" them down into the sauce. Cover with lid
   and simmer 5 more minutes.
7. Add remaining coconut milk plus fish sauce and sugar, stirring everything
   together and briefly simmering (fish is cooked when it easily flakes -
   usually 5-7 minutes is enough).
8. Reduce heat to low and taste-test the sauce. If not flavorful enough, add a
   little more fish sauce; if too salty or spicy for your taste, add more
   coconut milk. More chili can be added if you prefer it spicer. Sprinkle over
   fresh coriander and serve immediately with rice.
