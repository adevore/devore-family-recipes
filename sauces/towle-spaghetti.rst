Towle Family Spaghetti Sauce
============================

The Towle family spaghetti sauce came from my great-grandmother's
Italian butcher. It has been changed over the years, but the
essentials have stayed the same.

Ingredients
-----------

* 1 pound hamburger
* 1 onion, diced
* 1-2 cloves garlic (optional)
* 14 oz can diced tomatoes, **undrained**
* 6 oz can tomato paste
* 1/2 tsp sugar, any kind, to balance tomato acidity
* salt and pepper (tiny)
* Italian seasoning

  * oregano (essential)
  * basil (essential)
  * rosemary (nonessential)
  * sage (nonessential)

Addons
------

* peppers
* mushrooms
* shredded carrot

Instructions
------------

1) Brown hamburger: medium-high heat, no oil. Drain fat with a bulb
   syringe into a container (suggestion: a tomato can) and place in
   freezer. Discard after frozen.
2) Saute onions in the sameskillet, possibly just pushing the meat to
   the side. Add garlic near the end.
3) Put all ingredients in a pot.
4) Simmer for 20-60 minutes
