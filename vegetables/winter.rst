Squashes: Butternut squash, sugar pumpkins

Selection
=========

Select any combination of the above vegetables. They are all close in texture,
taste, and cooking times. Find what is fresh and local at your store.
Vegetables that are in season will usually be the lowest in price.

Select some herbs and spices that will go well with the vegetables. For
example, yams, rosemary and kosher salt go well together.

Divide into two groups if you want some served as a starch and others as a
vegetable side dish or if you think their cooking times will differ
significantly.
